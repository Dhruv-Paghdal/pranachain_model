Findings:
1. Biochemical Tests (Primary Predictors)

The study is a systematic review and meta-analysis of 37 studies evaluating diagnostic tests for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and prediabetes.
- Standard diagnostic cut-off (≥6.5%) is highly specific (97.3%) but moderately sensitive (50%).
- Optimal lower cut-off (~6.03%) improves sensitivity to 73.9% with acceptable specificity (87.2%).
- Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) test:
- Optimal cut-off (~104 mg/dL) provides high sensitivity (82.3%) and specificity (89.4%).
- Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) remains the gold standard reference for diagnosing T2D.
- Random Plasma Glucose (RPG) can be used when fasting is not feasible, but is less accurate.
- Adjusting diagnostic thresholds can improve early detection without greatly compromising accuracy.
- Key implication: Using multiple biochemical markers (HbA1c, FPG) and optimized cut-offs enhances detection of diabetes.
- The study supports the importance of balancing sensitivity and specificity in diagnostic testing.
- These findings can guide feature selection and thresholding for predictive models for diabetes.

Commonly included in diabetes risk models:

- Age – risk increases with age.
- BMI / Obesity indicators – overweight/obese individuals are at higher risk.
- Family history of diabetes – strong genetic component.
- Hypertension / Blood pressure – often associated with insulin resistance.
- Lipid profile – elevated triglycerides and low HDL may be risk markers.
- Lifestyle factors – diet, physical activity, smoking, alcohol.
